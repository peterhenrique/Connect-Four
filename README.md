# Connect-Four
This is my first real project using ttd, on which i'll apply the red-green-refactor process to create a simple connect four game


#update oct 13

I've tried to use the red-green-refactor process and was rather successful in creating a working game, the process has showed itself to be far quicker than if I put everything on a command line all the time. There were some functions that I could not manage to refactor though, probably due to lack of experience.
